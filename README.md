# Python Rekor Monitor Template
This is template code for an assignment in Software Supply Chain Security class.


## questions and notes:
 - there is code update from Mayand, check it out
 - need to check on the cryptography lib
 - why is the bundle command not formatting the PEM?
 - why is my PEM encoding wrong? should I base64 it?
 - what is the commented out section in util? (file manipulation)
 - the flow of work?
 - what is "sane"?
 - checkpoint interpretation?
 - is command line generated code/data part of the submission?
 - naming?
 - stdout of cert from bundle diff from command output file content
 - ephemeral? does that mean I literally have to act fast for it to work out? or only need to check data consistency?
